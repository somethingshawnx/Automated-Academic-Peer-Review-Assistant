<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An automated essay evaluation system is a machine-based approach leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) model to award grades to essays written in English language. natural language processing (NLP) is used to extract feature representations from the essays. The LSTM network learns from the extracted features and generates parameters for testing and validation. The main objectives of the research include proposing and training an LSTM model using a dataset of manually graded essays with scores. Sentiment analysis is performed to determine the sentiment of the essay as either positive, negative or neutral. The twitter sample dataset is used to build sentiment classifier that analyzes the sentiment based on the student's approach towards a topic. Additionally, each essay is subjected to detection of syntactical errors as well as plagiarism check to detect the novelty of the essay. The overall grade is calculated based on the quality of the essay, the number of syntactic errors, the percentage of plagiarism found and sentiment of the essay. The corrected essay is provided as feedback to the students. This essay grading model has gained an average quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) score of 0.911 with 99.4% accuracy for the sentiment analysis classifier.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, there has been a surge in the growth of internet-related technology. Because of the advanced methods by which students learn, prepare, and undergo the examination, online exams have gained significant importance in educational institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In today's world, not only examiners but also computers such as automatic essay evaluation are used to mark essays, since manual grading is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency and errors. In applications that perform automatic essay grading, the latent semantic analysis is used as a data reclaim tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This automated essay evaluation system grades essays on a scale of 1-10 and eliminates the time-consuming process of manually grading the essays. The system can perform anytime grading of essays unlike the manual grading process which is normally performed during the working hours of the evaluator <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Sentiment analysis, also known as sentiment or polarity classification analyzes student's opinion from the essay for the provided topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The polarity can either be positive, negative or neutral. His system performs grading of essays based on the features extracted from the essay using natural language processing (NLP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The machine learning model leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract  ISSN: 2088-8708 Int J Elec &amp; Comp Eng, Vol. 12, No. 6, December 2022: 6585-6593 6586 features from the submitted essay. The extracted features are used to further create feature vectors to judge the quality of the essay using LSTM model. The syntactic errors are detected using the language tool which includes the grammatical and spelling mistakes performed by the student in the essay. The system also checks for the novelty of the essay through a plagiarism check using Bing search from various web sources. A naïve Bayes classifier is used to build the sentiment classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The quality of the essay is graded on a scale of 3, the marks for syntactic errors and plagiarism percentage is deducted from a scale of 3 each. If the sentiment of the essay does not agree with the expected sentiment for the topic provided, 1 mark is deducted from the total score. Based on the syntactic errors detected, the essay is modified and the corrected essay without any errors is provided to the student and the detected errors are accompanied with the type of the error, and an example as part of the feedback to the students.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> shows the physical representations of various kappa values. If the metric is below 0, it indicates that there is less agreement between the raters. The QWK is computed between the automatically generated score and the resolved score of human raters on each set of essays <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Experiment setup</head><p>LSTM organizations-are considered to be an extraordinary form of recurrent neural network (RNN), used for learning large haul dependencies. Remembering data for considerable stretches of time is essentially their importance. All RNNs possess a type of chain of rehashing modules of neural network.

Furthermore, each of variable is weighted the input vector , , and are weight matrices and bias vector parameter. Moreover, also used sigmoid function , tanh function tanh. At each time step t, LSTM produces a hidden vector output that affects the semantic representation of the essay residing at position t. The ultimate representation of the essay is again subjected to feature extraction in the self-information layer. We have trained two models for predicting grades and to perform sentiment analysis for an essay submission. The grade prediction model was trained on 12,000 essays belonging to 8 different contexts with each essay having manual grades graded by two teachers. The sentiment analysis model was trained on twitter dataset containing positive and negative samples of data.</p></div>

Grades for the essays is provided out of 10 by considering sentiment analysis, plagiarism check and syntactic errors. Essay provided as input to the essay grading model. Once the essay is submitted, it is subjected to the detection of syntactic mistakes such as spelling and grammatical errors. The essay is then checked for plagiarism. If plagiarism is found, the plagiarized URL along with the corresponding plagiarism percentage is retrieved. It also gives the total plagiarism percentage that is necessary to award the final grade. Now, the essay is subjected to sentiment analysis with the help of the classifier. The expected sentiment and the detected sentiment are compared and marks are deducted if they are not identical. Based on these parameters a final grade along with a comment is provided to the student. As a part of feedback, the students are also provided with the corrected essay.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a model that uses NLP and machine learning to help educational institutions award grades to students based on their essay submissions to produce much accurate and unbiased results with less time consumption. Based on their advantages such models are thought to have a great potential in the future in various fields. This system leverages an LSTM network model. The model was trained with nearly 12,000 essays where each essay was graded by two manual graders. It was trained using K-fold mechanism for 5 folds and each fold operating for 10 epochs each with a batch size of 64. The model was then evaluated using QWK metric that depicted an average score of 0.911. A naïve bayes classifier was employed to build a sentiment classifier to determine either the positive or negative approach of students towards a topic. This classifier showed an accuracy of 99.4%. Along with which the system also detects syntactic errors in the essay such as spelling or grammatical mistakes and provides detailed feedback regarding the same to the students for further corrections.</p><p>A plagiarism detector was built to determine if the student has plagiarized any content from the open web sources. If so, the plagiarized URL along with the percentage of plagiarism is depicted. All the above parameters that include number of syntactic mistakes, amount of plagiarism, and the quality of the essay are considered to award the final grade to the student. As a part of maintenance and to improve the performance of the model further gradually, each essay submitted to the essay scoring system is appended to the dataset and the model will be trained on a periodic basis. This would further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the system. Future scope of this system involves exploring much enhanced characteristics to improve the results and make the system more advance. A student's fluency in English can be attempted to judge through the vocabulary and style of language adopted while writing the essay. The feedback features can be further exploited to provide a much valuable and meaningful comments to students for their better performance in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
